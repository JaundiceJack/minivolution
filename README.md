# minivolution

<h1>MiniVolution</h1>
<p>This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.</p>
<p>The rules for cell generation are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cells with less than 2 neighbors die from underpopulation</li>
  <li>Cells with 2 or 3 neighbors live to the next generation</li>
  <li>Cells with more than 3 neighbors die from overpopulation</li>
  <li>Empty space with exactly 3 neighbors produces a new cell</li>
</ul>

<p>The game can produce complex patterns just by following the simple rules above,
  calling to mind the evolution of life from single celled organisms to web developers.<p>
